  # catalogue at /opds that KOReader on the Kindle subscribes to.
  #
  # Reachability: a Pangolin resource → the WireGuard site at
  # http://10.253.0.4:8083, exactly like Jellyfin / Nextcloud / Matrix.
  # Deliberately NOT in services/caddy.nix: the caddy vhosts exist for names
  # covered by the *.corne.sh wildcard (→ 10.10.10.10), whereas a Pangolin
  # resource gets its own public A record at the VPS, which overrides the
  # wildcard for LAN and Tailscale clients too. A caddy entry here would be
  # dead config — which is why jellyfin, nextcloud and matrix have none.
  #
  # The Pangolin resource must have Pangolin's OWN auth DISABLED. Its login is
  # a browser portal and KOReader's OPDS client can't complete it; calibre-web's
  # own login is the auth boundary instead. Same trade Jellyfin already makes.
