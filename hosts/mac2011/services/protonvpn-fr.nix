  # ProtonVPN-France exit node — runs in a systemd-nspawn container with its
  # own tailscaled identity ("atilla-proton"). Tailnet devices picking this
  # node as their exit route get sent out via ProtonVPN-France.
  #
  # Split routing inside the container: tailscaled's own outbound (control
  # plane, derp) goes via veth → atilla → WAN; tailnet-forwarded traffic
  # (iif tailscale0) goes via wg-protonvpn-fr. If wg goes down, forwarded
  # traffic is dropped (kill switch — no fallback in custom table) but the
  # node itself stays reachable for debugging.
  #
  # One-time setup:
  #   1. ProtonVPN dashboard → WireGuard → create config for a France server.
  #      From the downloaded .conf, copy:
  #        PrivateKey  → /var/lib/protonvpn-fr/private  (chmod 600 root:root)
  #        PublicKey   → peers.publicKey below
  #        Endpoint    → peers.endpoint below
  #        Address     → address below (typically 10.2.0.2/32)
  #   2. nrs on atilla.
  #   3. Inside the container, register the tailscale identity:
  #        sudo nixos-container root-login atilla-proton
  #        tailscale up --advertise-exit-node --accept-dns=false \
  #                     --hostname=atilla-proton
  #      Open the printed URL to authenticate. In the Tailscale admin
  #      console, approve the exit node.

  # can create wg interfaces.
