# Dendritic Nix Agent Playbook

This repository uses a dendritic-style Nix flake layout for NixOS and Home Manager modules.

When command-line diagnostics are needed, ask whether you should run the commands instead of instructing the user to run them. Exception: if the command needs elevated permissions (sudo), instruct the user to run it.

Before running or instructing diagnostic commands, check which machine the agent is currently on by running `hostname`. Run local commands directly if already on the target host; use SSH only if on a different machine.

Do not run `sops` commands directly; they break the TUI. Instruct the user to run them.

## Network Context

- This environment is behind CGNAT.
- Do not assume direct public inbound reachability by default; prioritize LAN/Tailscale/internal exposure in security assessments unless explicit port forwarding or reverse tunnels are configured.

## Nix Linting Hygiene

- Avoid repeated top-level keys in a single attrset (Statix W20), especially `sops.*`.
- Prefer grouping related values under one key, for example `sops = { secrets.<name> = ...; templates.<name> = ...; };`.

## Library Helpers

- Reusable helper functions live in `lib/`.
- `config.flake.lib.iconOverrides`: icon theme override utilities from `lib/icon-overrides.nix`.
- `config.flake.lib.resolve`: resolve NixOS module paths from string names.
- `config.flake.lib.resolveHm`: resolve Home Manager module paths from string names.
- `config.flake.lib.resolveDarwin`: resolve Darwin module paths from string names.
- `config.flake.lib.sopsHelpers`: SOPS helper set with `rootOnly`, `wheelReadable`, `worldReadable`, `mkSecrets`, `mkSecretsWithOpts`, and `mkSecret`.

## Host Machine Metadata

- Host machine details are defined in each host module under `hostMeta` and exported via `flake.meta.hosts`.
- Primary location pattern: `modules/hosts/**`.
- Use `hostname` to identify the current machine, then find the matching record in `flake.meta.hosts` by `name`.
- Treat `hostMeta` as the source of static intent (model/fleet metadata, addressing, role-oriented fields).
- Treat runtime facts (current firmware, live microcode revision, active peripherals, temperatures, uptime) as diagnostics to check on-host, not static metadata.

## Container Services Policy

**IMPORTANT**: All container services MUST use Podman Quadlet (systemd container units), not custom build services or docker-compose.

- Use `environment.etc."containers/systemd/*.container"` for container definitions
- Reference pre-built images from registries (Docker Hub, ghcr.io, etc.) when they exist
- Do NOT create custom systemd build services; if upstream has no images, ship a build helper command instead
- Declare ports in `services.exposedPorts` AND open them with `networking.firewall.*` in the same module — keep firewall rules colocated with the service that needs them
- Use native Quadlet fields for resource limits (`Memory=`, `PidsLimit=`, `CPUQuota=`), not `PodmanArgs=`

## Port Allocation

**IMPORTANT**: When adding new services that expose ports, always validate against existing port assignments to avoid collisions.

Check for conflicts by searching the codebase for existing port usage before assigning a new port:
```bash
rg "port = [0-9]+" --type nix
rg "listen.*:[0-9]+" --type nix
```
